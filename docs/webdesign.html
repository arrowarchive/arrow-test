        <p> I've been thinking a lot about web design recently. With HTML code, I can restructure my website so it can look more professional. I made a markup image of my website's layout (left) a website for a series that will be coming to television (middle) and the layout for an art blog I follow (right).</p>
        <p> Each layout is professional in its own right, but there's something I've noticed about the others compared to mine:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> The about page is the equivalent of the index file </li>
            <li> The navigation commands are always by the profile picture </li>
            <li> for the right blog, there <i>is</i> an archive button, but not in the regular sense; in the blog itself, there is a button for a tag called "my art", and it groups all the art under that tag. </li>
                <li> for the other two pages, the social media links always take the form of icons. I think I can do the same, but I wonder how the placement of the icons was determined </li>
        </ol>
        
            <p> I feel like when converting my default repository to HTML, I may go for a layout similar to the middle website. It is close to my current layout, but I'm wondering if I can implement a tag system like the blog I follow. It would be the first step in creating a search system, and it would be fun to give my images funny tags. </p>
            
            <p> I see a lot of possibilities for HTML in my future for HTMl, the question is: <i>HOW?</i> I feel like it won't be hard to make html files to replace the markdown ones, but I don't know how to restrain images so they don't take up the whole page or shrink them without fear of distortion and creating a million commits to try and fix it. I appreciate any help I can get along the way, as I want to make my dream a reality and make my art portfolio the best it can be! </p>
