        <img src="images/omabruh.png" alt="time to explain this one"

        <p>The image on the front page was from a game called <i>Tee-KO</i>. It was an image I found funny and used as a placeholder every time I had to create a new directory, since directories would not show up on <i>GitHub</i> unless I put a file in them. Originally, I used blank markdown files as the placeholders, but it lost its touch after a while and I decided to use this picture instead. Am I losing track of things? am I rambling? oh whatever, I hope this provides some insight as to why I use the image all the time.  </p>
